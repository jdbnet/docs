Sometimes when booting a Linux ISO you get an error message come up that says ```you need to load the kernel first```

To fix this, you just need to disable secure boot in your BIOS

I have this come up whenever I create a new Proxmox VM that uses UEFI so thought I'd document it in case I forget or if anybody else comes across this issue
